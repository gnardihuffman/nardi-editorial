            <p>I started out writing for people, based largely on my own research and reporting. That led to developmental editing and copyediting, as well. From writing full-length treatments, scripts and feature articles to refreshing a page of website copy, I'd love to help. Let's talk it over. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My work is detail-oriented, well researched, and polished—on deadline! I offer innovative solutions.</p>
